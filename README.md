# Phylogenetic Biology - Final Project

## Guidelines - you can delete this section before submission

This repository is a stub for your final project. Fork it, develop your project, and submit it as a pull request. Edit/ delete the text in this readme as needed.

Some guidelines and tips:

- Use the stubs below to write up your final project. Alternatively, if you would like the writeup to be an executable document (with [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/), [jupytr](http://jupyter.org/), or other tools), you can create it as a separate file and put a link to it here in the readme.

- For information on formatting text files with markdown, see https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ . You can use markdown to include images in this document by linking to files in the repository, eg `![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)`.

- The project must be entirely reproducible. In addition to the results, the repository must include all the data (or links to data) and code needed to reproduce the results.

- If you are working with unpublished data that you would prefer not to publicly share at this time, please contact me to discuss options. In most cases, the data can be anonymized in a way that putting them in a public repo does not compromise your other goals.

- Paste references (including urls) into the reference section, and cite them with the general format (Smith at al. 2003).

- Commit and push often as you work.

OK, here we go.

# Optimizing the phylogenetic position of the Hoatzin (Opisthocomidae) using Bayesian analyses with calibration

## Introduction and Goals
Over the past thirty years, several large molecular and morphological datasets have illuminated the once obscure shape of the avian tree of life (e.g., Clarke and Mayr, 2003; Ericson et al., 2006; Hackett et al., 2008; Jarvis et al., 2014; Prum et al., 2015; Suh et al., 2015; Kimball et al., 2019; Kuhl et al., 2020). Unfortunately, the evolutionary origins of one clade, the bizarre hoatzins (Opisthocomidae), have remained elusive. 

Several analyses have placed this group at varying positions near the base of Passerea and Telluraves (Jarvis et al., 2014; Prum et al., 2015; Kimball et al., 2019; Kuhl et al., 2020). Affinities with turacos have also been suggested, although the evidence for this relationship has been thoroughly questioned (Field and Hsiang, 2018). Some fossil evidence might indicate a possible affinity with Cariamiformes, a group of predatory terrestrial stalkers now restricted to the southern hemisphere (e.g., Mayr, 2016); exquisite gut content preservation in some fossil skeletons of early-diverging cariamiforms also indicates these animals may have been herbivorous (Mayr and Richter, 2011) as in modern hoatzin. However, there have been no studies to date that integrate morphological and biogeographic evidence from fossils with improved phylogenetic methods for molecular data to tackle the problem of hoatzin origins.

The goal of our (C.D.B. and J.L.-M.) project is to use improved dating techniques and phylogenetic comparative methods to critically assess and compare different hypotheses for the origins of the hoatzin. This is intended to be part of a larger study lead by us and colleagues at the American Museum of Natural History aimed at (1) using computed tomography to provide a detailed description of the partial skeleton of an Eocene bird from North America that shows a high number of osteological similarities with Opisthocomidae and (2) conducting a phylogenetic analysis of putatitive fossil hoatzin using an expanded morphological dataset that intensely samples fossil and extant taxa in groups with which previous workers have allied Opisthocomidae (Gruiformes, Strisores, Cariamiformes, Musophagidae, Galloanseres, Charadriiformes, derived Telluraves).

We intend to have workflow proceed as follows. First, we intend to take advantage of the number of previously conducted Bayesian analyses of avian relationships by accessing topologies found in four recent molecular avian phylogenies (Jarvis et al., 2014; Prum et al., 2015; Kimball et al., 2019; Kuhl et al., 2020) to use as bases. We then hope to provide updated fossil calibrations using recently described early-diverging members of key candidate relatives of Opisthocomidae and putative fossil hoatzins (e.g., Mayr et al., 2011; Nesbitt et al., 2011; Ksepka et al., 2013; Mayr and Pietri, 2016; Mayr, 2016; Field and Hsiang, 2018; Musser et al., 2019) using a divergence estimation methodology based on a recent study that attempted a similar integration of fossil and extant information (Giles et al., 2017). Age dates will be compiled from the literature. Finally, we will use phylogenetic comparative methods to compute and compare statistics assessing support (branch supports and whole-tree indices) for particular relationships between Opisthocomidae and other clades.
