# Phylogenetic Biology - Final Project
# Revised calibrations of the avian tree of life substantiate the origins of the enigmatic Hoatzin (Opisthocomidae)

## Introduction and Goals
Over the past thirty years, analyses of several large molecular and morphological datasets have illuminated the once obscure topology of the avian tree of life (e.g., Mayr and Clarke 2003; Ericson et al. 2006; Hackett et al. 2008; Jarvis et al. 2014; Prum et al. 2015; Suh et al. 2015; Kimball et al. 2019; Kuhl et al. 2020). Along with this revolution in data collection, new dating techniques have increasingly allowed for the origins of the diversity of modern birds to be pinpointed in time. Time calibrations using recently discovered fossil specimens (e.g., Prum et al. 2015; Field and Hsiang 2018; Field et al. 2020a) have placed the divergence dates of the earliest extant birds in the latest Cretaceous (e.g., Field et al. 2020a). However, fossil and molecular data have also converged to support the hypothesis that the majority of extant bird diversity developed in an explosive radiation just following the K-Pg mass extinction (e.g., Jarvis et al. 2014; Prum et al. 2015; Ksepka et al. 2017; Berv and Field 2018; Field and Hsiang 2018; Field et al. 2020a). 

Despite these advances, the origins of several engimatic bird cladesremain poorly understood. The evolutionary origins of one the hoatzins (Opisthocomidae) have remained particularly elusive (e.g., Hughes and Baker 1999; Jarvis et al. 2014; Prum et al. 2015; Kuhl et al. 2020). For over thirty years, resolving the relationships of this group among other birds has formed a central project in avian phylogenetics (e.g., Hughes and Baker 1999; Jarvis et al. 2014; Kuhl et al. 2020). 

Frustratingly, analyses relying on different types of data (genomic sequences, transcriptomes, morphology, etc.) resolve hoatzins at very different positions within Aves. Several analyses have placed hoatzins at varying positions near the base of Passerea and Telluraves (Jarvis et al. 2014; Prum et al. 2015; Kimball et al. 2019; Kuhl et al. 2020). Affinities with turacos have also been suggested, although the evidence for this relationship has been thoroughly questioned (Field and Hsiang 2018). Some fossil evidence might indicate a possible affinity with Cariamiformes, a group of predatory terrestrial stalkers now restricted to the southern hemisphere (e.g., Mayr 2016); exquisite gut content preservation in some fossil skeletons of early-diverging cariamiforms also indicates these animals may have been herbivorous (Mayr and Richter 2011) as in modern hoatzin. 

To date, there have been no studies that integrate morphological and biogeographic evidence from fossils with improved phylogenetic methods for molecular data to tackle the problem of the origins of the Opisthocomidae. In this project, we use improved dating techniques to critically assess and compare different hypotheses for the phylogenetic affinities of the hoatzin and present new time-calibrated gene trees for clock-like genes taken from the datasets of two major studies of the avian phylogenetic tree (Jarvis et al., 2014; Prum et al. 2015). This work is intended to feature within a larger study centered around two main goals: (1) using computed tomography to provide a detailed description of the partial skeleton of an Eocene bird from North America that shows a high number of osteological similarities with Opisthocomidae and (2) conducting a phylogenetic analysis of putatitive fossil hoatzin using an expanded morphological dataset that intensely samples fossil and extant taxa in groups with which previous workers have allied Opisthocomidae (Gruiformes, Strisores, Cariamiformes, Musophagidae, Galloanseres, Charadriiformes, derived Telluraves). Using improved dating techniques will allow us to apply information from reevaluation of the aforementioned fossil material to assess the differing hypothesis for hoatzin origins currently proposed in the literature. 

We took advantage of the number of previously conducted Bayesian analyses of avian relationships by accessing trees produced from in two recent molecular phylogenies of birds (Jarvis et al. 2014; Prum et al. 2015). Using recently published occurrences of putative fossil opisthocomids (e.g., Mayr et al. 2011; Mayr and Pietri 2014) and age dates for the Willwood Formation specimen, we provide updated calibrations for the divergence time of this clade within the avian tree of life. We compared different calibration results including and excluding the early fossil 'hoatzin' material, much of which is highly incomplete and allied with Opisthocomidae by features that each are more widely distributed among Aves (e.g., Mayr et al. 2011; Mayr and Pietri 2014). The age of the definite Miocene fossil hoatzin *Hoazinoides* (Miller 1953), which we also intend to redescribe as part of the larger project, was used as a hard minimum calibration point for Opisthocomidae to test the effect of the assignment of this taxon to hoatzins on the timing of the extant radiation of birds. 

We supplemented these new age data specific to Opisthocomidae with additional novel calibrations of other Neornithine clades. In the past half-decade, several important fossils have been reported and reinterpreted as some of the oldest representatives early-diverging neornithine clades. For example, the recovery of the mostly complete skull and partial skeleton of *Asteriornis* from the Maastrichtian of Belgium provides a hard minimum age for the divergence of the Galloanseres, the most basal neognath clade, within the Late Cretaceous (Field et al. 2020a). Reevaluation of an extensive collection of avian postcrania from the late Maastrichtian New Egypt and Hornerstown Formations of New Jersey (Brownstein et al. in review) further supports the hypothesis that Galloanserans were diversifying before the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction. Reinterpretation of Paleogene fossils has confirmed that many extant neoavian clades, including  mousebirds (Ksepka et al. 2017), gruiforms (cranes and relatives; Musser et al. 2019), turacos (Field and Hsiang. 2018),  penguins (Slack et al. 2006; Mayr et al. 2017), strisoreans (Nesbitt et al. 2011; Ksepka et al. 2013; Chen et al. 2019), and cariamiforms (Mayr 2016), diverged early.

## Methods
## Fossil calibration selection
We systematically reevaluated and pruned taxa from the fossil calibration lists provided by Jarvis et al. (2014) and Prum et al. (2015). First, fossil calibrations in Jarvis et al. (2014) and Prum et al. (2015) based on taxa for which fragmentary or isolated postcranial material consistuted holotypes were pruned in order to limit phylogenetic uncertainty. This guideline was primarily based on the observation by both project authors (C.D.B and J.L.M.) and colleagues that isolated bird fossils from historical collections often possess complicated taxonomic histories and are difficult to place at low supraspecific levels. This pruning guideline allowed us to produce a dataset of fossil taxa that could provide strongly supported, or 'hard,' calibration ages. We also used this guideline to remove several  calibrations in the Jarvis et al. (2014) dataset that were both redundant with other calibrations in the Prum et al. (2015) list. Resultantly, *Lithoptila abdounensis*, known from an excellently preserved neurocranium, was the most incomplete fossil taxa in our pruned 'hard' calibration dataset. Second, we introduced several new calibrations based on recently recovered fossils placed in clades allied with the Opisthocomidae or otherwise highly consequential for dating the avian tree of life (i.e., recently recovered oldest examples of an early-diverging clade). These include Galloanseres, Cariamiformes, and Gruiformes. Third, we added the calibrations used in Ksepka et al. (2017) and Olivieros et al. (2019). The calibrations from the pruned Prum et al. (2015) and Jarvis et al. (2014) calibration list were also reassessed to see if they represented the oldest mostly complete fossils currently known for their respective lineages. For example, if a recently discovered fossil galliform was older than the fossil calibration in the Jarvis et al. (2014) and Prum et al. (2015) pruned dataset, we replaced the original calibration with the age of the more recently described fossil. 

We also used several incomplete records as 'soft' fossil calibrations for clades at the base of the extant avian tree (Paleognathae, Galloanseres; Figure 1) and the clade of interest Opisthocomidae. A possible Paleognath scapula used in Jarvis et al. (2014) and the holotype tibiotarsus of *Laornis edvardsanius* from the Hornerstown Formation of New Jersey (Figure 3) were included as soft calibrations for some runs. The authors have personally examined and phylogenetically assessed the *Laornis* holotype (Brownstein et al. in review) and felt confident about including these specimens as calibrators for one analysis. We also used *"Paracrax" wetmorei* as the soft calibration for the stem-Opisthocomidae (Figure 4) and *Bathornis grallator* as a soft calibrator for the stem-Cariamiformes. 

Precise dates for newly introduced fossil calibrations were taken from the literature referenced in Table 1. The final dataset comprised 45 distinct fossil calibration ages spanning the avian tree of life and is included in this repository as Hoatzin_calibrations.xlsx .

## Selecting clock-like genes
In order to efficiently handle the massive datasets used by Jarvis et al. (2014) and Prum et al. (2015), we took advantage of the recently published SortaDate package (Installation information available at: https://github.com/FePhyFoFum/sortadate; Smith et al. 2018) to identify regions of the dataset that behaved in clock-like fashion. Although this methodology reduces our ability to assess the absolute accuracy of our calibrations, it does allow us to efficienty compare the effects of different calibrations, which is the goal.

We selected the Jarvis et al. (2014) dataset with hard fossil calibrations only for use in a minimum viable analysis trial. This was advantageous given that the Jarvis et al. (2014) dataset was already used in the example script for SortaDate on the repository corresponding to the package. SortaDate shops for genes that seem to match the molecular clock using three statistics: the variance of root-to-tip lengths in gene trees, the similarity of individual gene trees to a given species tree as found using a bipartition, and gene tree length. We found these tree statistics for the Jarvis et al. (2014) and Prum et al. (2015) datasets by doing the following. We navigated to the directory consisting of the folder downloaded from https://github.com/FePhyFoFum/SortaDate. We also downloaded the phyx program using Homebrew on the command line (for commands, see here: https://github.com/FePhyFoFum/phyx). The original SortaDate directory already includes data from Jarvis et al. (2014), as this dataset was used by the programmers of SortaDate as an example dataset. For the search of the Prum et al. (2015) dataset for clock-like genes, we downloaded SortaDate once more to create a second, identical directory and then replaced the Jarvis et al. (2014) alignments and gene trees in the 'examples' folder with those from Prum et al. (2015). Once we had downloaded the directory in each case, we used the code provided in the attached Command_Line_SortaDate text file to run SortaDate on the dataset. SortaDate directories, including modified code, for selecting clock-like genes from both the Jarvis et al. (2014) and Prum et al. (2015) gene alignment and gene tree datasets are included in this repository as tar.gz files labeled SortaDate-master-JARVIS.tar.gz and SortaDate-master-PRUM.tar.gz. 

Because our goal was to select a gene alignment to use in the Bayesian calibration of a given topology, we selected the gene corresponding to the gene tree with the highest bipartition support. This corresponded to gene 10062 in the Jarvis et al. (2014) dataset (root-to-tip variance = 0.00108223, tree length = 1.57155, bipartition support = 0.391304347826). Among the three good genes selected from the Jarvis et al. (2014) dataset, this one had the second lowest tree length and the highest root-to-tip variance. The higher root-to-tip variance value found for 10062 makes sense in the context of avian evolution, which in the Jarvis et al. (2014) final phylogeny was characterized by low evolutionary rates deep in the tree. 

For the Prum et al. (2015) dataset, we manually copied the gene trees and trimmed alignments from the Prum et al. (2015) supplement into the examples folder in the SortaDateMaster directory. We then ran a modified version of the SortaDate code (see Modified_Prum_Code on the github repository) to assess which of the genes in the Prum et al. (2015) data acted in the most clock-like manner. We selected locus 184, which had the lowest root-to-tip variance (=0.000829973), the second lowest tree length (=8.39003) and the lowest bipartition support value (=0.61421319797) of the three most clock-like genes found by SortaDate. The corresponding gene tree and alignments were then copied in BEAUTi for XML file building. 

## Bayesian analysis specifications
We entered the fasta file corresponding to the selected gene from the Jarvis et al. (2014) phylogeny into BEAUTi terminal to build an XML file for analysis in BEAST v. 2.5.2 (Drummond and Rambout, 2007). Following Prum et al. (2015), we entered the General Time Reversable Model into the Substitution Model box on the Site Model tab. We then selected the Random Local Clock in the Clock Models tab and entered in the starting tree in the Starting Tree tab and unchecked 'Adjust Tip Heights' to fix the tree. Molecular evolutionary rates are highly variable across different bird lineages. The Relaxed Clock allows for rate heterogeneity among branches and is therefore an excellent  model for working with the highly heterogenous rates among birds (Prum et al. 2015). Non-avian outgroups (e.g., Crocodylia in Prum et al. 2015) were pruned following previous studies to remove high rate heterogeneity that might unreasonably affect age estimation. 

One issue encountered when entering the data into BEAUTi was that the gene selected in the SortaDate analysis lacked the tip *Gavia* from the tree produced from the total-evidence nucleotide alignment partitioned by sequence type that had been analyzed with maximum likelihood under a GTR+GAMMA model in Jarvis et al. (2014). We also wanted to drop edge lengths in the gene tree to give BEAST a 'skeletal' topology to time calibrate. We elected to do these in the R package ape. The R file that includes this code and thee corresponding steps has been deposited in this repository as R_Code_For_Dropping_Gavia_Jarvis.R. The XML file specifications were the same for the analyses of the Prum et al. (2015) with the exception of the pruning conducted. In the case of the Prum et al. (2015) analysis, the two crocodylians included in the alignments file and gene tree needed to be dropped (see Introduction and Goals). This was accomplished using the RCode_for_dropping_crocs_prum.r script included in this repository. We also manually corrected name formatting issues in the gene tree originally provided by Prum et al. (2015) so that the taxon names in the gene tree matched those in the alignment. 

To ensure we fixed the topology in BEAST for each analysis, we set the Wilson-Balding, subtree slide, and narrow and wide exchange operators to 0 in the Operators tab (Prum et al. 2015). We used the Birth-Death model in our Priors and entered the calibration ages following a lognormal distribution (specified in the 'model parameters' box) into Clade Ages. Following Prum et al. (2015), we navigated to the Priors tab in BEAUTi and added a loose gamma prior to the node including all Neornithes. We then adjusted the distribution so 97.5% of the calibration density fell later than 86.5 Ma, the upper age estimate of the Niobrara Formation in the western United States (Prum et al. 2015; Field et al., 2018b; Field et al. 2020a). This was done because the Niobrara Formation preserves an excellent record of non-neornithine birds but to date has not produced a single neornithine specimen. We accomplished this by adjusting the values of alpha and beta. We set the chain length to 10 million, saved the specifications and data to XML files, and uploaded the XML files to BEAST for analysis. In order to increase our working efficiency for analysis of the larger Prum et al. (2015) dataset, we submitted the xml files generated from the Prum et al. (2015) BEAUTi specifications to the Yale computer cluster (farnam) as a batch job using the write_job_file.sh code included in this repository and the following commands: 

bash write_job_file.sh > job_file.txt
module load dSQ
dsq --job-file job_file.txt -J Prum_BEAST --max-jobs 400 --mem=10G -c 1 -t 24:00:00 -p general,scavenge

The xml files were stored in a folder labeled xml on the cluster for organizational purposes. After the required log and tree files were generated, we used LogCombiner to specifiy a burn in by selecting "Tree Files" for the file type in the LogCombiner interface and then uploading the .trees file containing the generated calibrated trees for each analysis. A burnin of 25% was specified. We then used TreeAnnotator to summarize the trees in a maximum clade credibility tree (the tree with the highest product value for the posterior probabilities of clades across nodes). FigTree was used to format the resulting trees.

The XML files containg these specifications, the log, tree, and states files generated from each analysis, and the final nexus file containing the maximum clade credibility tree for each analysis are all included in this repository. For the Jarvis et al. (2014) analyses, these files are compressed as Jarvis_hardcal.tar.gz
and Jarvis_softcal.tar.gz. The size of the individual files used in or generated from the Prum et al. (2015) analyses were too large to include them in a single compressed file, and so they are included in the repository individually. The .trees files generated from the Prum et al. (2015) analyses were also too large to include in this repository and have been uploaded to Google Drive (https://drive.google.com/file/d/19JSFJOkOmrvmXcgZ6A8kOxbZVG3vVpZY/view?usp=sharing; https://drive.google.com/file/d/16AL7RnrJHFfCVz6Blw_tK9PKnZrBLK3L/view?usp=sharing). 

## Results
## Calibrations of the Jarvis et al. dataset
The resulting time-calibrated maximum clade credibility tree from the analysis of the Jarvis et al. (2014) dataset with hard calibrations generally found earlier divergence times for major avian clades when compared to the original result (Figure 2; Figure 5). Opisthocomidae was found to diverge from other neornithine clades 70.3509 Ma, which is slightly older than the 65.7432 Ma age found for the divergence of Cariamidae from other representatives of Australaves. Both of these ages are older than other bifurcations near the base of the tree, such as the estimated divergence of Tinamiformes from Struthioniformes (53.0479 Ma) in Paleognathae or that of Galliformes from Anseriformes (69.731) in Galloanserae. Since the Galloanserae is the second earliest diverging clade of neornithines (Fig. 1-2, Fig. 4-7) and the only extant one for which definite members are known from the Mesozoic (Field et al. 2020a), it is intriguing that the divergence dates for some of the extant groups within this lineage and Paleognathae are placed 1 to 6 million years later than most of the deep divergences within Neoaves (Fig. 5). This is probably mostly attributable to two factors: (1) the clock-like nature of the gene selected probably caused underestimation of the abrupt rate changes associated with the radiation of neornithines that occurred around the K-Pg boundary (e.g., Mayr and Clarke 2003; Ericson et al. 2006; Hackett et al. 2008; Jarvis et al. 2014; Prum et al. 2015; Ksepka et al. 2017; Berv and Field 2018; Kuhl et al. 2020) and (2) the hard minimum age of Galloanseres set by the discovery of the skull and skeleton of *Asteriornis* from the Maastrichtian of Belgium (Field et al. 2020a). Indeed, the result found in this analysis contrasts with even the original Jarvis et al. (2014) maximum credibility tree, which found that most groups of neognath neornithines originated just after the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction. The result in Figure 5 also does not closely compare with those of a large number of studies using other datasets, which converge on a picture of bird evolution wherein the majority of clades originated in an explosive radiation directly following the mass extinction at the end of the Mesozoic (e.g., Hackett et al. 2008; Prum et al. 2015; Ksepka et al. 2017; Berv and Field 2018; Field and Hsiang, 2018; Field et al. 2018a; Field et al. 2020a; Kuhl et al. 2020).

By slightly modifying the fossil calibration priors inputted into BEAST from the minimum viable analysis run of the hard calibration Jarvis et al. (2014) dataset, we were also able to quickly run an analysis on the Jarvis et al. (2014) dataset using the soft calibration dataset. The time-calibrated maximum clade credibility tree from the analysis of the Jarvis et al. (2014) dataset with *soft* calibrations gave similar, if slightly older, divergence times as the hard calibration tree.  Opisthocomidae was found to diverge from the Gruiformes+Charadriiformes clade 70.7654 Ma, a very slightly older age than that found in the hard calibration analysis. Cariamiformes was found to diverge from other members of Australaves 66.6906 Ma, approximately one million years earlier than the date found in the hard calibration analysis. The soft calibration dataset included older dates for only Paleognathae (the cf. *Lithornis* scapula from the latest Maastrichtian Hornerstown Formation, 66.7 Ma) and Opisthocomiformes (the "*Paracrax*" *wetmorei* material from the Eocene Willwood Formation, 47.8 Ma). Given that the cf. *Lithornis* scapula dates to the same age as the more derived galloanseran neornithine *Asteriornis*, it is unlikely the slightly older divergence dates found for clades in Neognathae in the soft calibration analysis than in the hard calibration round (Figure 5; Figure 6) are attributable to the change of the Paleognathae calibration. Instead, these very small age changes seem to have originated with the major shift in the minimum age of Opisthocomiformes associated with the replacement of *Hoazinoides* (~16 Ma) with "*Paracrax*" *wetmorei*. In any case, the changes to the calibration times found between calibrations of the selected gene tree in the Jarvis et al. (2014) dataset using hard and soft fossil calibrators are clearly minimal and do not greatly effect the overall timing of important divergences in Neornithes found in our analyses.

## Calibrations of the Prum et al. dataset  
The calibrated maximum clade credibility tree from the Bayesian analysis of the selected gene from the Prum et al. (2015) was generally similar to that found in the analysis of the Jarvis et al. (2014) in the divergence times given for major clades within Neornithes (Fig. 7). In the analysis using the hard calibration dataset, the majority of branches in Neoaves were found to diverge either during the Campanian and Maastrichtian Stages of the Cretaceous or in the earliest Paleogene. This result approximates that found in Prum et al. (2015), where the explosive radiations of much of extant bird diversity were dated to just after the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. Opisthocomidae was found to diverge from the rest of Inopinaves 81.5136 million years ago, whereas the divergence date of Cariamidae was placed 79.8987 million years ago. It is important to note that the gene tree topology for locus 184 differs in several ways from the final tree produced in Prum et al. (2015). The divergence date for Anseriformes from Galliformes was placed at 82.4597 Ma, and the divergence of the Galloanserae at 86.2972 Ma. These dates are approximately ten million years older than the corresponding ones in the Jarvis et al. (2014) hard calibration analysis, but similar to those found in the soft calibration analysis. Interestingly, divergence of the Struthioniformes from the rest of Paleognathae was estimated to occur 41.5988 Ma, which is ten million years later than the corresponding date found in the Jarvis et al. (2014) hard calibration dataset. This discrepancy serves to demonstrate the non-uniformity of age date shifts observed when using the different gene alignment and species tree datasets.

Blue bars indicate 95% confidence intervals for divergence times. Asteroid symbol indicates the date of the K-Pg extinction event.**

In analysis of locus 184 of the Prum et al. (2015) dataset using the soft calibration dataset (Fig. 8), the Opisthocomidae was found to diverge 80.5762 million years ago, 1.697  million years later than the divergence of the Cariamidae from all other clades at 78.8792 Ma. Comparison of the dates found in the soft calibration dataset with those found from the analysis the hard calibration dataset on the Prum et al. (2015) data show a similar pattern to the comparisons between the Jarvis et al. (2014) runs. Although divergence dates are generally placed older in time in the soft calibration run, the shifts in divergence dates found for clades of interest like the Opisthocomidae, Cariamidae, and Galloanseres (Anseriformes-Galliformes split = 67.2737 Ma; Galloanserae origin = 86.8028) did not shift more than 2 million years in time. Interestingly, all these dates are younger than the corresponding ones found in the Prum et al. (2015) hard calibration run. This is probably because the older inputted prior calibrations for Opisthocomidae, Cariamidae, Paleognathae and Anseriformes in the soft calibration analysis better constrained the timing of diversification event by placing the divergences of stem-anseriform and stem-lithornithid paleognaths firmly in the end-Maastrichtian 67-66 million years ago.

## Likelihood and posterior estimates

The log-likelihood values for the four different analyses generally converged upon values well, as shown by the fairly normal marginal density distributions in Fig. 9. The posterior values, however, did not converge to particular values over the 10 million generations specified. Traces for both the posterior and likelihood values did not present the idealized 'caterpillar' shape of random movement around a particular value. Instead, the posterior value increased throughout the ten million generations and the likelihood value found clear local maxima and minima (Fig. 10). ESS values for both were less than 200 (Table 2). The marginal density distributions for the posterior values in the analyses using the gene selected from the Prum et al. (2015) dataset appear more strongly left skewed than those from the analyses using data from Jarvis et al. (2014). This might reflect either the much larger size of the Prum et al. (2015) dataset and the greater number of priors used for calibration of the lineages included within it.

## Discussion
Dating the early divergences of birds has remained a major challenge in ornithology. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of testing different calibration schemes given the uncertain phylogenetic positions of some important latest Cretaceous fossil avians (e.g., Field et al. 2020a). Berv and Field (2018) also found that the body masses of birds, when considered as continous traits, can effect estimations of the timing of the radiation or radiations that produced extant birds. Because of these issues, the description and phylogenetic analysis of early members of derived clades within Neornithes has formed a major research programme within paleoornithology over the past twenty years. These include the earliest known members of Coliiformes from the Paleogene of southwestern North America (Ksepka et al. 2017), the earliest known Galloanseran from the latest Cretaceous of Belgium (Field et al. 2020), partial skeletons of a possible early anseriform from the latest Cretaceous of Antarctica (Clarke et al. 2005; Clarke et al. 2016), and the reevaluation of the possible earliest representative of Musophagidae  from the Eocene of the Green River Formation in Wyoming (*Foro panarium*; Field and Hsiang, 2018). These discoveries have helped to substantiate a tentatively minimum bound for the divergence time of Neornithes in the middle or Late Cretaceous. The maximum bound for the age of this clade has been pushed into the middle or even Early Cretaceous, in large part based on the comprehensive review and reevaluation of important Coniacian-Santonian marine bird faunas in the western interior of North America that lack neornithines but include large numbers of closely related taxa (e.g., Clarke 2004; Longrich et al. 2011; Field et al. 2018b). 

Because the emerging picture of avian evolution from the fossil record and molecular phylogenetic analyses is one of the early evolution of extant clades in the latest Cretaceous followed by the explosive radiation of most groups following the K-Pg extinction, it is to be expected that the earliest fossils of the major clades within Neoaves are found in the early Paleogene. However, the earliest fossils currently assigned to the clade Opisthocomidae are from the late Eocene (~35 Ma), 30 million years younger than the K-Pg boundary (Mayr and De Pietri 2014). This Eocene record consists of loosely associated fragments of the pectoral girdle and hindlimb from France (Mayr and De Pietri 2014). These were assigned to a new taxon of opisthocomiform, *Protoazin*, by Mayr and De Pietri (2014) based on the presence of (1) an elongated procoracoid process oriented perpendicular to the bone, (2) a pneumatic foramen subtending the procoracoid process, (3) a medially elongated scapular cotyla extending onto the procoracoid process, and (4) a large opening placed on the dorsal surface of the sternal extremity. However, essentially all these characters are distributed elsewhere among Neornithes (Mayr and Clarke, 2003) and (1) is difficult to verify because of the incomplete nature of the coracoid in the region of interest (Mayr and De Pietri 2014). Given these issues and the low the low sub-family taxon sampling employed in the phylogenetic analysis of *Protoazin* presented by Mayr and De Pietri (2014), this early French record should be viewed as a fairly unreliable calibrator for Opisthocomiformes. 

In our analyses, the inclusion of the holotype of *"Paracrax" wetmorei* in the soft calibration dataset as a fossil calibrator for Opisthocomiformes was not associated with substantial changes to the divergence dates found for that clade and others relative to the results of the analyses using the hard calibration dataset. This is important, because the holotype of *"Paracrax" wetmorei* is 12.8 million years older than the French taxon *Protoazin* and 42.5 million years older than the oldest definite hoatzin *Hoazinavis* (Jarvis et al., 2014; Prum et al., 2015). The replacement of *Hoazinavis* with *"Paracrax" wetmorei* as a calibrator of stem-hoatzins in the Jarvis et al. (2014) analyses only resulted in a shift in the divergence date of Opisthocomiformes of 414,500 years. The corresponding shift in the divergence date for Opisthocomidae between the Prum et al. (2015) runs was over four times larger at 1.8956 million years, although this change is minimal when considered alongside the larger timing of important divergences in the trees generated from calibration of the Prum et al. (2015) dataset (Fig. 7, Fig. 8). These results demonstrate that if the holotype of *"Paracrax" wetmorei* is a stem opisthocomiform as we suspect, it does not substantially change the divergence time for this clade in molecular analyses. Given that both the age of *"Paracrax" wetmorei* and the estimated divergence times for Opisthocomidae in the 'hard' and 'soft' calibration scheme analyses are all more than 10 million years older than the age of the putative early hoatzin *Protoazin* (Mayr and De Pietri 2014), the inclusion of *Protoazin* as a calibration would likely not have impacted our results behind reducing slightly the difference in the Opisthocomidae divergence times found in the 'hard' and 'soft' calibration analyses. 

Similar results were found for other clades of interest. For example, the use of *Bathornis grallator* as a calibrator for Cariamiformes following its assignment by Mayr (2016) to that clade only changed the age of the estimated divergence time for this group among the analyses of the Jarvis et al. (2014) dataset by 0.9474 million years and among the analyses of the Prum et al. (2015) dataset by 0.0632 million years. The influence of using *Asteriornis maastrichtiensis* as a calibrator for Galloanserae in the place of fragmentary neornithine records from the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary of New Jersey, USA (e.g., Jarvis et al., 2014; Brownstein et al. in review) minimally changed the age of this group among analyses, as did including a Paleocene example of *Lithornis* as a calibrator for Paleognathae instead of a putative scapula representing this taxon in the same New Jersey deposits (Jarvis et al. 2014). These results further demonstrate that major changes to the calibrations of clades of interest within Neoaves do not necessarily result in substantially different divergence time estimates for those groups.

It is important to emphasize that the results of the analyses presented in this study should not be interpreted as strongly supported absolute divergence dates. The past few decades of research into avian phylogenetics have established the probable existence of a major shift in nucleotide substitution rates across avian clades around the time of the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction (e.g., Berv and Field 2018; Field et al. 2020b). This shift in substitution rates might explain the uncertainty in calibrations of the timing of the major radiations that produced modern avian diversity around this important stratigraphic boundary (Ericson et al. 2006; Hackett et al. 2008; Jetz et al. 2012; Jarvis et al. 2014; Prum et al. 2015; Suh et al. 2015; Berv and Field 2018; Kimball et al. 2019; Kuh et al. 2020; Field et al. 2020b). Because genes specifically selected for their clock-like nature were selected for the phylogenetic analyses presented here, the results were expected to conflict with the consensus result that most extant bird clades radiated just after the K-Pg extinction. The use of clock-like genes inherently assumes some level of rate uniformity; even though a random local clock was specified, a sudden rate shift reflected in the calibrations corresponding to the post-K-Pg diversifications of neornithine birds is not expected for the genes in the datasets of Jarvis et al. (2014) and Prum et al. (2015) that most closely follow a molecular clock pattern. Even though the inclusion of recently described early representatives of Neornithes like *Asteriornis* as calibrators might push back the divergence dates for neornithine lineages in analyses using the whole of the Jarvis et al. (2014) and Prum et al. (2015) datasets, we do not interpret the results presented here to suggest this is definite. 

One aspect of the results that additional runs of the datasets might help account for are the poor effective sample size values found for the likelihood and posterior values found for the analyses presented here. As noted above, this issue is likely due to both the size of the datasets used and the large number of priors specified. Cross-run comparisons of the resulting divergence dates could allow for a better understanding of the effects of these issues on estimation of the divergence times of clades of interest like the Opisthocomidae and Cariamiformes. 

## Conclusions
On the whole, the chronograms presented here suggest that the inclusion of recently described and currently undescribed early members of Opisthocomiformes, Cariamidae, and Galloanserae in the calibration of major avian molecular datasets does not substantially change estimated divergence times for these groups from the values found using older data. This conclusion might seem obvious from observation of the phylogenies originally built using the molecular data analyzed in this study, which found the deep divergences of the aforementioned clades to originate early in the Cenozoic (Jarvis et al. 2014; Prum et al. 2015). However, the instability of age dates found for neornithine clades under different calibration schemes in the published literature (see Field et al. 2020b) warranted that the effects of these new, early represenatives on time-calibration of major avian molecular phylogenies be tested *a priori*. 

Although the chronograms generated using these early representatives support the result expected based on the original Jarvis et al. (2014) and Prum et al. (2015) phylogenies, they nonetheless serve as an important proof of concept. Our results demonstrate how information from the fossil record and molecular data may be  integrated efficiently to assess the impact of new paleontological discoveries on our understanding of the evolution of birds before the necessary anatomical descriptions and comparisons are performed. Assessing the effects of different fossil calibration schemes on molecular datasets serves to show both the alignment of the molecular record with the fossil record and the correspondence of fossil exemplars to the ages of clades found in previously calibrated molecular phylogenies. In this way, the effect of new fossils on the estimated ages of clades in molecular phylogenies can be used as a heuristic for whether further investigation of the fossils is warranted, especially if they are fragmentary. Although we recognize the importance of using fossil calibrators distributed through tree branches as a way to account in part for rate variation (e.g., Benton and Donaghue, 2007; Ho and Phillips, 2009), we also urge caution about disregarding the fragmentary nature of many fossil calibrators used in previously published avian phylogenies (e.g., Jarvis et al. 2014). Testing the influence of poorly characterized fossils against that of more complete ones on hypotheses of the avian evolution will allow molecular phylogenetics to help maintain rigor in the description and interpretation of new specimens from deep time.
